Bank Marketing Effectiveness Prediction

Banks generally do an advertising cmpaign to get more funds from customers or give more loans.
In this project a bank of Portugal is trying to enroll customers in a Term Deposit by runnaing a marketing Campaign.
This project discusses the prediction model of Bank Marketing Effectiveness of a Portuguese Marketing institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. 

ðŸŽ¯ The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit.

First we explore the data, cleaned and preprocessed the data and then we performed the exploratory data analysis to extract information, in which we identified certain trends, relationships, correlation and found out the features that had some impact on our dependent variable and plotted the graph to visualize the impact on dependent variable. We also encoded the categorical variables. 

We build the various machine learning algorithms on our split and standardized data. We tried different algorithms namely; Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, K Neighbors Classifier, XG Boost and Naive Bayes Classifier. We did hyper parameter tuning and evaluated the performance of the model.
